                        Firstly, Bazin's argument on depth of field and realism in cinema emphasizes the importance of capturing the three-dimensional depth of the real world to convey a sense of realism on screen. Bazin believed that the essence of cinema lies in its ability to reproduce reality, and depth of field plays a crucial role in achieving this. By allowing multiple planes to be in focus simultaneously, depth of field enhances the audience's perception of the spatial relationships within a scene, thereby creating a more immersive and realistic viewing experience.

                        Secondly, Prince's notion suggests that cinema has always aimed for immersion, yet it is limited by the interactivity factor critical for virtual realities. Prince argues that while traditional cinema can create a sense of immersion through narrative and visual techniques, it lacks the interactive element that is central to VR experiences. This highlights the inherent challenge in fully immersing viewers in cinematic experiences, as true immersion requires a level of engagement and participation that conventional cinema cannot provide.

                        "A Machine for Viewing" exemplifies VR cinema by pushing technological boundaries, offering viewers immersive storytelling experiences that transcend traditional cinematic constraints. This VR film integrates spatial storytelling and viewer interaction, allowing the audience to explore the narrative from different perspectives. By doing so, it blurs the lines between the spectator and the spectacle, making the viewer an active participant in the storytelling process.

                        Through VR experimentation, cinematic storytelling has entered an evolving landscape, allowing filmmakers to explore new narrative possibilities and immerse audiences in unprecedented ways. VR technology enables creators to craft stories that are not confined to the rectangular screen, providing a 360-degree canvas for storytelling. This evolution challenges traditional narrative structures and opens up opportunities for innovative storytelling techniques, such as branching narratives and environmental storytelling, where the environment itself becomes a crucial element of the narrative.
